New challenges in remote sensing require the design of a pixel classification method that once trained can generalise to other areas of the Earth (\cite{maggiori17a}). Much of the extraction of features from satellite imagery is performed by human analysts and with that comes time delays, increased cost and increased errors (\cite{mnih13}). The aim of this project is to produce a semi-automatic, pixel-based, image classification process that reduces the human element thus reducing costs, errors and time.
