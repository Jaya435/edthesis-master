New challenges in remote sensing require the design of a pixel classification method that once trained can generalise to other areas of the Earth (\cite{maggiori17a}). Much of the extraction of features from satellite imagery is performed by human analysts and with that comes time delays, increased cost and increased errors (\cite{mnih13}).
Convolutional Neural Networks are a new and emerging technology for image classification and come as a result of significant advances in the field of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. The convolutional layers within the network "learn" features which may be based on colour as with traditional pixel-based classification, but also create edge detectors and various other feature extractors that could exist in a region of pixels that would not be recognised by traditional pixel by pixel based classifications.

The aim of this project is to produce a semi-automatic, pixel-based, image classification process that reduces the human element thus reducing costs, errors and time.
