\chapter{Introduction}
This technical document is intended to accompany the work presented in Richmond (2019), which presents a workflow and evaluation of the use of Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification problems. The document will begin with an overview of the datasets used to train and validate the network, followed by a detail description on how to construct a neural network, how to prepare the data and how to test the validity of the output. Finally there will be an evaluation of the tools as well as a discussion on the reproduciblity of the work for the future.
\newline
At the end of this document there will be a list of appendices with the input metadata and the code structure along with the source code. Locations within the code structure will be highlighted throughout this document as points in which users of the code should input their own datasets.
